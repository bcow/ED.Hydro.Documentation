\begin{itemize}
    \item 50-ha long term forest monitoring plot
    \item central Panama
    \item (lat, lon)
    \item moist lowland tropical predominantly evergreen forest, only 10\% of canopy drops leaves during the dry season %\citep{condt_2000} 
    \item mean annual precipitation of $2662 \pm 479$ (SD) mm yr$^{(-1)}$ and a 4-month dry season ($<$ 100 mm per month)  
    \item average annual rainfall of about 2640 mm (Detto et al.,
2018) and a well-marked dry season (total rainfall between late-December and mid-April is about 175 mm on average). 
    \item Why is BCI a good choice for this study?

 Meteorological data of the simulated years were available at hourly resolution for air temperature, wind speed, specific humidity, precipitation rate, short- and longwave radiation, and were hence used as ecosystem upper boundary condition. 
 
 Two years were chosen to represent the two extremes in the avaialable data: the shortest and wetest dry season and the longest and dryest dry season, which  
 
 % I should ask Felicien about CO2 ... To exclude CO2 fertilization effects and keep the same meteorological drivers as in our previous study (di Porcia e Brugnera et al., 2019), the atmospheric concentration of CO2 was fixed at a constant value of 370 ppm, which corresponds to initial concentrations measured by the flux towers.

Because ED2 is a DGVM, it uses the dynmaics of PFTs. Thus we need to talk about how we define PFTs. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item In this case, plant functional types (PFTs) are defined as a collection of species. 
    \item These species are cross-listed with a database of plant traits. 
    \item This data can then be used to constrain probability distributions that define our apriori knowledge of the parameter values for the plant traits in question. 
    \item To initialize parameter values for a model run in ED, a Bayesian meta-analysis is performed in which posterior distributions are calculated for each model parameter value included in the analysis, and then values are randomly selected from the distribution. Note that the current meta-analys system does not allow for joint distribution sampling. 
    \item The scope of this study is to focus on the propagation of parameter uncertainly over small timescale processes, competition between PFTs was not included. Thus, the PFT used is a general tropical PFT, consisting of the combination of early, mid and late species.
\end{itemize}

    \item ED2-hydro Tropical PFT: http://psql-pecan.bu.edu/bety/pfts/1000000131
    \item ED2 TropicalPFT: http://psql-pecan.bu.edu/bety/pfts/1000000132
    \item The PFTs are based on clones of a FATES prior, and then species were added in during the meta-analysis. Should I discuss this process?

\todoq{
This part of the analysis hasn't really been developed yet. Koven 2020 cites Detto 2018 as having observational eddy-covariance data such as GPP, LH, SH as well as observations of LAI.

Some form of model validation would be important to show that ED2-hydro is in fact making reasonable predictions while simultaneously reducing predictive variability. However, especially given \citep{powell_2018} showing the strength in ED2-hydro's predictive performance at this very site, I don't feel a particular need to spend a lot of time on benchmarking in this paper (also this takes time!). I'd like to hear other opinions on this. }
